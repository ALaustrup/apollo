### Example Integration

```python
from apollo.blockchain import ApolloDemiurgeIntegration

# Initialize integration
integration = ApolloDemiurgeIntegration()

# Get Apollo's assistance
response = integration.get_apollo_assistance(
    creator_id="your_creator_id",
    task_type="smart_contract",
    request="I need help designing a token contract",
    context={"project": "Your Project Name"}
)

print(response["apollo_response"])
print(response["suggestions"])
print(response["resources"])
```
